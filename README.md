# üõ°Ô∏è RuntimeObfuscator - Protecting Your Code Made Easy

## üöÄ Getting Started

Welcome to RuntimeObfuscator! This tool helps you protect functions in your C/C++ programs on Windows by hiding their actions while your program runs. It relocates the code in memory, using Windows exception handling for seamless function execution. Follow these steps to download and run the tool.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later.
- **Programming Languages Supported:** C and C++.
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB of RAM recommended.
- **Storage:** 100 MB of free disk space.

## üìÇ Features

RuntimeObfuscator provides several important features to enhance your programs:

- **Dynamic Function Obfuscation:** Changes the code during runtime to prevent easy reverse engineering.
- **Memory Relocation:** Moves code to different memory locations to protect its logic from static analysis.
- **Windows Exception Handling:** Utilizes built-in Windows mechanisms to call obfuscated functions seamlessly.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with average computer users in mind, no programming experience required.

## üîç How It Works

1. **Obfuscation:** When you run the tool, it will take the functions you choose and make modifications to them. These changes hide the true functionality.
   
2. **Memory Management:** The obfuscated code is stored in different areas of memory. This helps prevent anyone from easily tracking down the original functions.

3. **Execution:** When your program calls a function, the tool uses Windows exception handling to jump to the new location of the moved code.

## üìä Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider these common solutions:

- **File Not Found:** Ensure that you have selected the correct path for your C/C++ program. 
- **Permission Denied:** Run the tool as an administrator if you face access issues.
- **Unexpected Behavior:** Check if your system meets all requirements. Review your obfuscation settings.

## ü§î Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is there a limit to how many functions I can obfuscate?**  
A: No, you can obfuscate as many functions as your system can handle, but overloading may affect performance.

**Q: Can I revert my program back to the original version?**  
A: It is recommended to keep a backup of your original code. The obfuscation process modifies the code, and it is not reversible.

**Q: Is RuntimeObfuscator suitable for commercial applications?**  
A: Yes, you can use the obfuscation in commercial projects, but please review any licensing agreements associated with your usage.
